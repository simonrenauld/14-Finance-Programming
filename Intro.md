# Algorithmic Trading and Finance Programming

### Human idea into language of maths and so as programming

1. *** Math is formulation of human ideas *** it's a tool!

2. Scary maths language:: each step specific rules. Mathematical toolkit and when to apply which rule.->  practice

3. Coding And algorithm: debugging is coding. 

4. Understand codes strategy: train.py and eval.py starting point.  Overview base 

5. Success or failure: stop learning too quick 




# Algorithmic Trading and Finance Programming

Algorithmic trading and finance programming involve using mathematical models and software tools to execute trades on financial markets automatically. Here's an overview of key concepts, tools, and techniques used in this field:

## Key Concepts

- **Algorithmic Trading**: The use of computer algorithms to automatically make trading decisions, submit orders, and manage trades based on predefined criteria.
- **Quantitative Finance**: The application of mathematical models to solve problems in finance, including pricing derivatives, risk management, and investment strategies.
- **Backtesting**: The process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: A type of algorithmic trading that involves executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds.
- **Market Microstructure**: The study of the processes and outcomes of exchanging assets under explicit trading rules.

1. **Mastering Finance Languages**
    - **Natural language**:
        Today, the English language is the only relevant language in the field when it comes to published research, books, articles, or news.
    - **Financial language**:
        Like every other field, finance has technical terms, notions, and expressions that describe certain phenomena or ideas that are usually not relevant in other domains.
    - **Mathematical language**:
        Mathematics is the tool and language of choice when it comes to formalizing the notions and concepts of finance.
