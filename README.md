# Algorithmic Trading and Finance Programming

### Human idea into language of maths and so as programming

*** Math is formulation of human ideas *** it's a tool!

Scary maths language:: each step specific rules. Mathematical toolkit and when to apply which rule.->  practice

Coding And algorithm: debugging is coding. 

Understand codes strategy: train.py and eval.py starting point.  Overview base 

Success or failure: stop learning too quick 


Algorithmic trading and finance programming involve using mathematical models and software tools to execute trades on financial markets automatically. Here's an overview of key concepts, tools, and techniques used in this field:

## Key Concepts

- **Algorithmic Trading**: The use of computer algorithms to automatically make trading decisions, submit orders, and manage trades based on predefined criteria.
- **Quantitative Finance**: The application of mathematical models to solve problems in finance, including pricing derivatives, risk management, and investment strategies.
- **Backtesting**: The process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: A type of algorithmic trading that involves executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds.
- **Market Microstructure**: The study of the processes and outcomes of exchanging assets under explicit trading rules.

## Programming Languages and Tools

- **Python**: Widely used due to its simplicity and powerful libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and more specialized libraries such as QuantLib and TA-Lib.
- **R**: Popular in statistical analysis and data visualization, with packages like quantmod and TTR for financial modeling.
- **C++**: Preferred for high-frequency trading systems due to its performance and efficiency.
- **MATLAB**: Used for mathematical modeling, simulations, and prototyping of trading strategies.
- **Java**: Often used in the development of trading systems and platforms.

## Popular Libraries and Frameworks

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **SciPy**: For scientific and technical computing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For deep learning models.
- **QuantLib**: For quantitative finance.
- **TA-Lib**: For technical analysis.
