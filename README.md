# Algorithmic Trading and Finance Programming

### Human idea into language of maths and so as programming

*** Math is formulation of human ideas *** it's a tool!

Scary maths language:: each step specific rules. Mathematical toolkit and when to apply which rule.->  practice

Coding And algorithm: debugging is coding.

Success or failure: stop learning too quick 


Algorithmic trading and finance programming involve using mathematical models and software tools to execute trades on financial markets automatically. Here's an overview of key concepts, tools, and techniques used in this field:

## Key Concepts

- **Algorithmic Trading**: The use of computer algorithms to automatically make trading decisions, submit orders, and manage trades based on predefined criteria.
- **Quantitative Finance**: The application of mathematical models to solve problems in finance, including pricing derivatives, risk management, and investment strategies.
- **Backtesting**: The process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance.
- **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: A type of algorithmic trading that involves executing a large number of orders at extremely high speeds.
- **Market Microstructure**: The study of the processes and outcomes of exchanging assets under explicit trading rules.

## Programming Languages and Tools

- **Python**: Widely used due to its simplicity and powerful libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and more specialized libraries such as QuantLib and TA-Lib.
- **R**: Popular in statistical analysis and data visualization, with packages like quantmod and TTR for financial modeling.
- **C++**: Preferred for high-frequency trading systems due to its performance and efficiency.
- **MATLAB**: Used for mathematical modeling, simulations, and prototyping of trading strategies.
- **Java**: Often used in the development of trading systems and platforms.

## Popular Libraries and Frameworks

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **SciPy**: For scientific and technical computing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For deep learning models.
- **QuantLib**: For quantitative finance.
- **TA-Lib**: For technical analysis.

An economy is an abstract notion that subsumes other elements of the financial model, like assets (real, financial), agents (people, institutions), or money. Like in the real world, an economy cannot be seen or touched. Nor can it be formally modeled directly—it rather simpli‐fies communication to have such a summary term available. The single model ele‐ments together form the economy.


### Real Assets

Multiple real assets are available in the economy that can be used for different pur‐poses. A real asset might be a chicken egg or a complex machine to produce other real assets. At this point, it is not relevant who, for example, produces the real assets or who owns them.


### Agents

Agents can be thought of as individual human beings being active in the economy. They might be involved in producing real assets or consuming them or trading them. They accept money during transactions and spend it during others. An agent might


### Cash Flow


Combining time with currency leads to the notion of cash flow. Consider an invest‐ment project that requires an investment of, say, 9.5 currency units today and pays back 11.75 currency units after one year. An investment is generally considered to be a cash outflow, and one often represents this as a negative real number, c ∈ ℝ<0, or, more specifically, c = –9.5. The payback is a cash inflow and therewith a positive real number, c ∈ ℝ≥0, or c = +11.75 in the example.

### Return

Consider an investment project with cash flows c = c0,c1 = (–10, 12). The return R ∈ ℝ of the project is the sum of the cash flows R = c0+c1 = –10 + 12 = 2. The rate of return, r ∈ ℝ, is the return, R, divided by c0 , that is by the absolute value of the investment outlay today:
